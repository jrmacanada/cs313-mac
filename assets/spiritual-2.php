        <h2>Spiritual Thought #2</h2>
        <p>“No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; 
            or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.” (Matthew 6:24)</p>

        <p>I was reminded of this while reading the book <u>the ministry of business</u>, by Steven A. Hitz. 
            Advising against living a duplicitous life in which business or work ethics vary from family or church 
            morals, the author suggests that behavior must be consistent and righteous in all areas of life to benefit 
            the most from God’s blessings. </p>
        <p>He states, “It is nothing more than self-deceit to think you can be one person at home and someone totally 
            different at work.” The covenants we latter-day saints make connect us to heaven and are a full-time 
            commitment. We “commit ourselves to following His teachings in all places and in all times.” Hence, 
            “we are bound … in all aspects of our lives.”</p>
        <p>Hitz continues, “Only by living an honest, upright, charitable life … will our (connection) to heaven be properly maintained.” 
            Only through obedience to our covenants can the promise of revelation by the gift and power of the Holy Ghost 
            be assured and made real. His guidance is best when applied to all aspects of our life.</p>
