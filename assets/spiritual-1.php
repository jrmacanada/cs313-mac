        <h2>Spiritual Thought #1</h2>
        <p>I feel the doctrine of eternal progression that we have in the LDS Church is the greatest provided with the 
            restoration. If we are not progressing in the gospel, we fall short of our godly potential and risk being 
            hobbled by Satan. The warning for such a fate is stated early in the bible (Genesis 3:15) when the serpent 
            is given the power to bruise our heel. Doubt is his tool that stops our progression. The remedy we have is 
            faith in Christ, which bruises the serpentâ€™s head. </p>
        <p>Is it any wonder the Church asks us to continue on the path of Christly perfection? So long as we are moving 
            to become more like Christ, we are moving away from Satan. This scripture marks the earliest reference to an 
            ultimate victory of mankind over the seed of the devil. It is a victory made sure through the atonement of 
            Christ, whose salvation frees us of the bonds of sin and opens the doors of our spiritual prison.</p>
        <p>To some degree, every religion represents a plateau of progression. Buddhists, Muslims, Jews, Catholics, and 
            Protestants alike have all stopped progressing toward the greater promises we have in the LDS Church. Our 
            promises through covenants exalt us to Godliness. Whereas all others will remain the sons and daughters of 
            God, we will progress to being mothers and fathers in Israel.</p>
